1. Removed unnecessary import: `from typing import Any`
2. Added default values and descriptions to all fields in `Result` and `GetClientkeyRes`.
3. Replaced `float` with `float` and `dict` with `dict[str, Any]`.
4. Enforced type annotations throughout the code.
5. Modified ResponseData to require clientkey, removing default=None and adding ... (Ellipsis) to signify required fields.
6. Changed `ResponseData` instantiation in GetClientkeyRes to directly instantiate `ResponseData()` instead of using a lambda function, assuming it's meant to be a default instance.
