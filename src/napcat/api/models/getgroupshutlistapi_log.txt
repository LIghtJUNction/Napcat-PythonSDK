1. Removed unnecessary imports.
2. Fixed type annotations for all fields.
3. Added descriptions and default values for all fields using `Field`.
4. Defined nested classes for request and response models.
5. Used `| None` for optional fields instead of `Optional`.
6. Applied camel case naming.
7. Refactored response data model for better structure.
8. Ensured that all models have the `extra = "allow"` configuration for extensibility.
9. Updated the API class to remove the instantiation of the logger within the class definition.
10. Corrected the type hint for the `group_id` field to be `str | int` as it accepts both string and number according to the OpenAPI definition.
