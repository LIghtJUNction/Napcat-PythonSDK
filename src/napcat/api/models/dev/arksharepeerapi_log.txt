Removed unnecessary `user_id`, `group_id`, and `result` component models as they were not aligned with the OpenAPI specification.
Corrected `ArksharepeerReq` fields `group_id` and `user_id` to `str | int | None` to accurately reflect the `oneOf string, number` type defined in the OpenAPI spec.
Modified `ArksharepeerRes.Data` fields (`errCode`, `errMsg`, `arkJson`) to be non-optional (removed `default=None`) as they are marked `required` in the OpenAPI specification and are not nullable.
Updated `ArksharepeerRes.status` to use `typing.Literal["ok"]` to reflect the `const: ok` definition from OpenAPI.
Ensured all `Field` definitions have clear descriptions and appropriate default values.
Set `retcode` default to `0.0` for explicit float type.
Removed unused `typing.Any` import and added `typing.Literal` import.
