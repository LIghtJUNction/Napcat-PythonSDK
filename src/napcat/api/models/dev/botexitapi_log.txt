Based on the provided OpenAPI specification and coding guidelines, I have performed the following fixes:
1. Removed the unused import `typing.Any`.
2. Replaced `status: str` with `status: Literal["ok"]` in `BotExitRes` to enforce the literal value as per the guideline.
3. Ensured all fields have explicit type annotations and descriptions using `Field`.
4. Confirmed that nested classes (`Data` within `BotExitRes`) are correctly defined.
5. Verified that `BotExitReq` correctly represents an empty request body as specified in OpenAPI.
6. Maintained `model_config = {"extra": "allow"}` for flexibility.
