1. Removed unnecessary imports (typing.Any).
2. Added default values to fields in `GetStatusRes.ResponseData`.
3. Added docstrings to classes and methods.
4. Modified the `GetStatusAPI` class to inherit from `object` instead of `BaseModel` because it is not a data model but rather a class for handling API calls.
5. Removed the `__init__` method from the `GetStatusAPI` class as it was not doing anything beyond what the parent class was doing.
6.  No request parameters defined, `GetStatusReq` remains an empty model.
7. Add default=None to all optional fields.
8. Fixed type annotations.
9. Add description to all fields
10. Fixed indentation issues
