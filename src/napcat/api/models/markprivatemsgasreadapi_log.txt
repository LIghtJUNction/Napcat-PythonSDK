Starting to fix and generate pydantic v2 models...
1. Removed unused imports.
2. Ensured all fields have type annotations.
3. Ensured all fields have descriptions and default values.
4. Moved nested classes inside the main class.
5. Simplified the API class by removing unnecessary logger initialization and call method implementation since it's just a data model.
6. Adjusted type hints to use built-in types instead of those from the typing module.
7. Modified the result model to represent the data field as nullable.
8. Simplified the `user_id` model to a `str | int` type based on the OpenAPI schema.
